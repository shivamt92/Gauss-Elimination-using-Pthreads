GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION USING PTHREADS : ECE 5720

The repository contains two implementations for computing Ax = b. It employs Gaussian Elimination and Back substitution for computing the solution. 

1. Gauss_Seq : Computes using Sequentially
2. Gauss_elm_parallel: Computes using Pthreads

This repo allows you to see the speed up acheieved using pthreads. 

Gauss_Seq: Takes the size of the matrix as an argument
Gauss_elm_parallel : Takes  the size of the matrix and no. of threads as argument.
